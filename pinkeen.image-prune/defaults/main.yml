# Services to stop prior to pruning.
# Notes: 
# - It's safe to list non-existent services the matches are performed
#   against the list of all running or enabled services.
# - By default services remain stopped - unless `restart` is enabled.
#   Note that usually you don't want to start services which create
#   caches on start. They will be started when user boots
#   a container from the image, so usually you'll want
#   all of them remain stopped until image is commited.
# - The `name_patterns` setting accepts regexps that will be
#   matched against base service name. Note thath in case 
#   of systemd the `.service` suffix is stripped before
#   matching, other unit types retain their full canonical name.
